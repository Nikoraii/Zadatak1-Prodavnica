# UNI PROJECT - Store
Small-scale Java project. You can buy some articles (Fruit, vegetables, etc), each one of them is created from the Article class, each purchase has a receipt 
at the end, and the store stores all receipts. You can print all receipts, the most expensive or least expensive ones, the average price for all of them and you 
can get a receipt for a certain date.
